# Predictive-Analytics-for-Business-Metrics

This project demonstrates predictive analytics for forecasting sales based on historical data. A simulated dataset capturing monthly sales, marketing spending, and store visits over two years was generated. The project employs a Random Forest regression model, optimized through hyperparameter tuning, to accurately predict future sales. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R² Score. Key features influencing sales are visualized to provide insights into their significance. The visualizations and analysis empower business stakeholders to make informed decisions based on predictive outcomes.
